# Fritz Unity SDK

## Installation instructions

In the Unity project, click Edit -> Project Settings -> Fritz. (If you do not see Fritz, make sure the package has been added. [See the documentation](https://docs.fritz.ai/develop/get-started/Unity.html?utc_source=github&utc_campaign=fritz-unity-sdk)).

### Add Fritz API Key

Create an app in Fritz that matches your bundle identifier set in Unity.

To access your Fritz API Key, make sure you've created an account and added your app [in the webapp](https://app.fritz.ai/login?utc_source=github&utc_campaign=fritz-unity-sdk).

You can change the bundle identifier in the iOS player settings in Unity by going to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Player -> Other Settings`.
